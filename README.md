# Fourth Project

Completed the fourth project for designing a currency converter app. This app lets you enter a USD amount and then it converts that amount to euros, pounds, yen, and swiss francs. I used a segue to
show the conversion after you click the button CONVERT. On the second View Controller it will show you the amount in USD entered and then the conversions.
